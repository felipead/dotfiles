# Developer Environment as Code

Builds and installs my development environment, synchronizing settings across different machines. The scripts are flexible enough to allow local customization, as required (eg: personal vs. work computers).

Only Mac OS X is fully supported at the moment.

I'm a happy [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) user and I have no shame to admit it. A long time ago I was a heavy *GNU Emacs* user. After I started using Mac OS X I got frustrated with Emacs' lack of support for `⌘ ←`, `⌘ →`, `⌘ ↓` and `⌘ ↑` shortcuts ([Aquamacs](http://aquamacs.org) is also very ugly). ~I may convert to *Vim* one day.~
