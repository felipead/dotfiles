Settings for Sublime Text 3 
===========================

**DISCLAIMER:** These scripts will only work for Sublime Text 3 under Mac OS X.

On Mac OS X these settings should be copied to folder `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`.

There's a `install.sh` script, just run it. The script will also install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).

The `create-shell-command.sh` script will create a `subl` shortcut so you can call Sublime Text from the command line (I personally find it very useful).
